# Copy & messaging style guide

## Voice
- Calm, respectful, plain English
- No hype, no “hard sell”
- Assumptive empathy (acknowledge stress without being dramatic)

### Writing rules
- Short paragraphs (1–3 sentences)
- Bullets over dense text
- Avoid jargon; if used, define it

## Core message pillars
1. **Options, not pressure**
2. **As-is** (no repairs, no showings)
3. **Local KC metro**
4. **Your timeline** (fast or flexible)
5. **Clear process**

## Approved phrases
- “No obligation”
- “As-is”
- “Cash offer”
- “Explore options”
- “We’ll explain the process clearly”

## Avoid / do not use
- “Guaranteed highest offer”
- “We pay top dollar” (unless you can substantiate)
- “Act now / limited time”
- “We can solve any problem”

## ZIP targeting (64131)
When referencing 64131:
- Use it naturally, 1–2 times per page.
- Tie it to real service intent: “We buy houses in Kansas City, MO 64131 and nearby areas.”

Avoid:
- Repeating “64131” excessively
- Stuffing multiple ZIPs into one paragraph

## Creative options disclosure (important)
If we mention mortgage-payment takeover / “subject-to” style structures:
- Be clear that the **seller’s loan may remain in the seller’s name**.
- Encourage homeowners to consult an attorney.
- Never imply lender approval if it’s not part of the process.

Suggested disclosure snippet (edit as needed):

> Some options may involve keeping the existing mortgage in the seller’s name while the buyer makes payments. These arrangements can carry risks and may trigger lender terms. We encourage you to consult an attorney or financial professional before deciding.

## Testimonials and reviews
- Do not publish fake reviews in production.
- If we have case studies, clearly describe what happened and what the seller valued (speed, simplicity, etc.).

## Calls to action (CTAs)
Primary CTAs:
- “Get My Offer”
- “Call/Text Now”
- “Tell Us About the Property”

Secondary CTAs:
- “See How It Works”
- “Explore Your Options”

## Reading level
Aim for:
- Grade 6–8 readability
- Simple words, clear verbs
