# Project overview

## Goal
Build **acepropertieskc.com** as a mobile-first, trust-first, SEO-friendly website that generates inbound leads from Kansas City metro homeowners who:

- want to sell **as-is** for cash, or
- need **options** beyond listing (including certain creative purchase structures when appropriate)

## Primary conversion actions
These should be persistent and obvious on mobile:

1. **Tap-to-call** (top priority)
2. **Tap-to-text**
3. **Short “Get an offer / explore options” form** (2-step)

## Audience and intent
Typical visitors:

- Are on a phone.
- Are under time pressure or emotional load (divorce, inherited property, repairs, code issues, job relocation, behind on payments, tenant problems).
- Need a site that communicates **safety, clarity, and control**.

What they want to know quickly:

- “Are you local and real?”
- “Will you pressure me?”
- “What are my options?”
- “How fast can this happen?”
- “Is there a catch?”

## Geographic scope
- Primary market: **Kansas City metro** (approximately 30-mile radius).
- Initial local SEO emphasis: **Kansas City, MO ZIP 64131** (build at least one dedicated page and ensure site copy references it naturally).

## Offer and positioning
### Core offer
- **Cash purchase, as-is** (no repairs, no clean-out, no showings).

### Secondary offer
- **Creative options** for homeowners who may not fit a standard cash sale.

> Note: Some creative structures (e.g., “subject-to” style transactions where title transfers but financing stays in the seller’s name) can involve lender terms such as due-on-sale clauses. Copy must be transparent and encourage sellers to consult legal/financial professionals.

## Trust posture
Design + content must communicate:

- Calm and respectful tone
- “Options, not pressure”
- Transparent process
- Local credibility

## Constraints and non-negotiables
- **No fake reviews** on production.
- Clear disclosures for:
  - “We are not attorneys; this is not legal advice.”
  - Any creative option that may involve leaving a mortgage in the seller’s name.
  - SMS/texting consent (if we text leads).

## Success metrics (launch targets)
- 30–60 days post-launch:
  - Site loads fast on mobile (Core Web Vitals in green).
  - Measurable inbound:
    - phone calls
    - form submissions
    - text conversations
  - Indexing + initial rankings for long-tail local searches (city + situation keywords, plus 64131).
