# SEO strategy (local + “low-hanging fruit”)

## Core principle
We are building for **real homeowner intent**:
- “I need to sell as-is, fast.”
- “I need options besides listing.”

We avoid thin, duplicated “SEO pages.” Instead, we publish fewer pages with stronger helpful content.

## Primary local target
- Service radius: **Kansas City metro (~30 miles)**
- Priority ZIP focus: **64131** (Kansas City, MO)

## Keyword strategy
We will target keywords with clear intent and reasonable long-tail competitiveness.

### 1) High-intent “cash / as-is” (core)
- sell house as-is Kansas City
- cash home buyer Kansas City
- cash offer for house Kansas City
- sell house fast Kansas City
- sell distressed property Kansas City

### 2) Situation-based long-tail (often lower competition)
- sell inherited house Kansas City
- sell house during divorce Kansas City
- sell house with tenants Kansas City
- sell house needing repairs Kansas City
- sell hoarder house Kansas City
- sell house behind on payments Kansas City

### 3) ZIP-level + hyperlocal
Use one strong ZIP page first, then expand if performance supports it.

- sell house fast 64131
- cash home buyer 64131
- sell house as-is 64131

### 4) Creative options (carefully worded)
This can drive niche leads, but we must be transparent.

- sell house with mortgage Kansas City
- take over payments Kansas City house (phrase varies)
- “subject to” real estate Kansas City (educational content)

> Note: “we buy houses” keywords are highly competitive. We can still include them, but long-tail situation pages usually rank faster.

## Page-level SEO rules
### Title tag templates
- City page: `Sell Your House As‑Is in {City} | ACE Properties KC`
- ZIP page: `Sell Your House As‑Is in 64131 | ACE Properties KC`
- Situation page: `Sell an Inherited House in Kansas City | ACE Properties KC`

### Meta description template
`Local Kansas City metro home buyer. Sell as‑is for cash or explore options. No repairs, no pressure. Start with a quick call, text, or form.`

### Header structure
- One H1 per page.
- Use H2s for: process, options, FAQs, service area.

### Internal linking
Every page should link to:
- `/get-offer/` (primary conversion)
- `/solutions/` and the most relevant solution page
- `/areas-we-buy/` or the relevant city/ZIP page

## ZIP 64131 page requirements
If we create `/areas/64131/`, it must be clearly differentiated from other area pages:

Include:
- A short statement that we buy in **Kansas City, MO 64131**
- A list of common seller scenarios for that area (repairs, inheritance, etc.)
- “How it works” (3 steps)
- FAQ specific to selling as-is / cash buyer expectations
- Clear CTAs

Avoid:
- Keyword stuffing
- Copied paragraphs from other area pages

## Technical SEO checklist (baseline)
- Fast mobile performance (image compression, minimal scripts)
- Clean URLs, consistent trailing slashes
- Canonical tags
- XML sitemap (auto-generated)
- robots.txt
- OpenGraph + Twitter meta tags
- 404 page

## Schema (structured data)
Implement JSON-LD:
- `LocalBusiness` (sitewide)
- `FAQPage` (on FAQ sections)

Only add `Review` schema when reviews are real.

## Local SEO signals
- Google Business Profile (service-area business)
- Consistent name/phone across site + listings
- Publish real reviews as soon as possible

## Content plan (first 10 pieces)
These are practical, high-intent topics that attract motivated sellers:

1. “How to sell a house as-is in Kansas City (what it really means)”
2. “Selling an inherited house in Kansas City: options and timeline”
3. “Do I need to clean out the house before selling?”
4. “Sell a house with tenants in Kansas City: what to expect”
5. “How cash home buyers determine an offer (transparent explanation)”
6. “Can I sell if I’m behind on payments? (Kansas City overview)”
7. “Divorce and selling a house: practical steps in KC”
8. “Major repairs vs. selling as-is: when it makes sense”
9. “What is a ‘subject-to’ deal? Risks and questions to ask” (educational, transparent)
10. “What happens after you contact ACE Properties KC (process + privacy)” 

## Measurement
Track:
- calls, texts, form submissions
- rankings for 64131 page + situation pages
