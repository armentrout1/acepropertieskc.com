      Estates come with paperwork, family emotions, and logistics. Our Kansas City team focuses on service-area homes, so we already know which title companies, clean-out crews, and attorneys keep things moving. Whether you just received letters testamentary or have been maintaining a vacant bungalow for years, we help you evaluate the property's condition, settle obligations, and either sell for cash or consider a creative structure that preserves income for the heirs.

        Title companies usually require a death certificate, probate orders, HOA statements, and payoff letters. We create a shared checklist (and can coordinate directly with your attorney) so you know which documents are pending. If probate is still in process, we keep the contract flexible to match court deadlines.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Closings typically occur two to four weeks after title receives everything. Need more time to remove belongings? We can schedule closing later or set up a written post-closing occupancy agreement. Everything is documented so every heir stays confident.
