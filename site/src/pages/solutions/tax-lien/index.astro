    <p class="text-muted">
      County tax liens escalate quickly—interest, redemption deadlines, and auction dates differ between Kansas City, Jackson County, Wyandotte County, and the surrounding suburbs we cover. ACE Properties KC focuses solely on this metro, so we understand how local treasurers and title companies process lien payoffs. We are not attorneys or tax advisors, but we do provide clear sale options and coordinate the paperwork so you can make an informed choice before penalties grow.

        Our first call covers the lien balance, any prior payment plans, and whether other liens (HOA, code violations, or utilities) exist. We outline realistic timelines—no promises we cannot keep—and encourage you to run everything past your attorney or accountant. Every offer is provided in writing with estimated net proceeds so you can compare against redemption costs.

        Some owners just need a clean sale that wipes out the lien at closing. Others want us to front the payoff and allow a short stay while planning the next move. We walkthrough each scenario, explain risks, and respect whatever decision you make—sell, refinance, or keep the property.
