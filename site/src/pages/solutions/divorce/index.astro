      Divorce already asks a lot of you. Selling a home on top of court hearings, mediation, and family logistics can feel overwhelming—especially when repairs, equity splits, or safety concerns enter the picture. ACE Properties KC works only within the Kansas City metro, so we know how Jackson, Johnson, Clay, and Wyandotte County title companies handle divorce-related documents. Our role is to keep communication even-handed, supply transparent offers, and respect the timeline set by the court or by mutual agreement.

      <p class="text-muted">
        We begin with a confidential intake call to understand your priorities—whether that means a quick cash sale, creative financing that preserves payments, or pausing to evaluate other options. Every major update is documented via email so both parties (and their attorneys) can reference the same information. If safety or privacy is a concern, we tailor walkthroughs and signings accordingly.

        Because we buy in neighborhoods highlighted on our <a href="/areas/" class="text-secondary underline">areas page</a>, we already understand HOA requirements, municipal inspections, and average closing timelines. That familiarity shortens the time between accepting an offer and receiving proceeds, whether you are in <a href="/areas/kansas-city-mo/" class="text-secondary underline">Kansas City, MO</a>, <a href="/areas/overland-park-ks/" class="text-secondary underline">Overland Park</a>, or nearby suburbs.

        Title companies typically request the divorce petition or decree, payoff letters, HOA statements, and any temporary orders dictating proceeds. We help gather these documents and coordinate signatures—digital if the court allows, in-person if required. Cash closings often happen within two to three weeks once paperwork is ready; creative agreements may take slightly longer but allow one spouse to remain in the home temporarily.
