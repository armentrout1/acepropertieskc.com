# Site map & information architecture

## Navigation (v1)
Keep the top navigation minimal (mobile-first):

1. Home
2. How It Works
3. Solutions
4. Areas We Buy
5. Reviews
6. Contact

On mobile, add a sticky CTA bar (Call / Text / Get Offer).

## Required pages (MVP)
These are the minimum pages we should launch with.

### Core
- `/` — Home
- `/how-it-works/`
- `/solutions/` (hub)
- `/areas-we-buy/` (hub)
- `/reviews/` (real only)
- `/about/`
- `/faq/`
- `/contact/`
- `/thank-you/` (form submission)

### Solutions (child pages)
- `/solutions/cash-offer-as-is/`
- `/solutions/creative-options/`
- `/solutions/inherited-house/`
- `/solutions/divorce/`
- `/solutions/major-repairs/`
- `/solutions/tenant-occupied/`
- `/solutions/behind-on-payments/`

### ZIP + city targeting
Start with a dedicated ZIP page to support the 64131 priority.

- `/areas/64131/` — “Sell Your House in 64131 (Kansas City, MO) As‑Is”

Then expand with a small set of high-value city pages (unique content):
- `/areas/kansas-city-mo/`
- `/areas/kansas-city-ks/`
- `/areas/overland-park-ks/`
- `/areas/olathe-ks/`
- `/areas/lees-summit-mo/`
- `/areas/independence-mo/`

## Funnel landing pages
These are separate from SEO city pages; they are optimized for conversion.

- `/get-offer/` — cash offer funnel
- `/options/` — creative options funnel

## Component inventory
Build once, reuse everywhere:

- Header + mobile menu
- Sticky mobile CTA bar
- Hero (headline, subhead, CTA buttons)
- Trust strip (icons + bullets)
- “How it works” 3-step block
- Solution cards (grid)
- Reviews carousel/list
- FAQ accordion
- Contact form
- Footer (service area, links, disclosures)

## Content rules (important)
- Each page has **one** clear primary CTA.
- Each page must include:
  - service area statement (KC metro)
  - at least 1 trust element (process clarity, reviews, disclosures)
  - internal links to relevant pages
